# Authenticated Gitlab DoS 3 - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption - 8CPU cores (16vCPU) &amp; 11GB RAM - Events Tracking - Low Bandwidth

Gitlab doesn't accept 99.9% of DoS vulnerabilities. This vulnerability is out-of-scope unfortunately üòî.

`DoS vulnerabilities caused by unlimited input fields`

Out-of-scope bugs are useless noise (üóëÔ∏è) ‚Äî they waste time chasing irrelevant issues that don‚Äôt impact the actual target, like reporting a typo in a login page‚Äôs footer. They distract from real threats, clog reports with garbage, and show you didn‚Äôt bother reading the rules.

Submitting them is like demanding a refund for a sandwich you didn‚Äôt order.

## üìä GitLab Event Flooder - Usage Guide
A Python script that sends randomized usage events to GitLab's track_event API to simulate heavy input loads with large property sets. Useful for stress testing analytics endpoints or exploring edge case behavior under unusual payload sizes.

## Impact

Auto-scaling under attack can cause a cost spike, potentially breaching budget thresholds or credit limits.

![Cloud Provider Response](images/cloud_provider_response.png)

**Attack Vector (AV:N)** - Attacker can exploit this remotely.

**Attack Complexity (AC:L)** - Attack uses a very simple python script.

**Privileges Required (PR:L)** - The endpoint is authenticated. Requires a simple account.

**User Interaction (UI:N)** - There's no user interaction required.

**Scope (S:C)** - Changed. Affects cloud hosting account if auto-scaling is enabled.

**Integrity Impact (I:N)** - None.

**Availability Impact (A:H)** - High. Instance becomes unavailable for at least 10 seconds and might self-restart.

From https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-security/product-security/appsec/cvss-calculator/

`When evaluating Availability impacts for DoS that require sustained traffic, use the 1k Reference Architecture. The number of requests must be fewer than the "test request per seconds rates" and cause 10+ seconds of user-perceivable unavailability to rate the impact as A:H.`

This attack used < 1RPS.

### Theoretical Impact

1. Advanced Monitoring Blind Spots: Alert Overload as a Smokescreen for Data Exfiltration

DoS attacks are very noisy by nature‚Äîcrashing services, flooding logs, and triggering alert storms. But that chaos can work in the attacker's favor. By overwhelming observability tools like Prometheus or Datadog with garbage metrics and cardinality explosions, an attacker can distract responders and degrade monitoring fidelity.

A DoS on GitLab instance, for example, might not be the end goal‚Äîjust the distraction. While teams scramble to stabilize GitLab, the attacker quietly hits a more valuable target elsewhere: cloud buckets, internal APIs, or CI-linked infrastructure.

2. Cloud Provider Blacklisting/Suspension

The attack causes 100%+ CPU usage over extended period of time.
Providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, etc. use heuristic models to flag "suspicious" resource consumption. Legitimate causes (e.g., DDoS attacks, unoptimized code, or intensive computations) might be **mislabeled as abusive**, leading to temporary account suspension.

Cryptojacking and Uncontrolled Resource Consumption are very similar in a way that they both use up computational resources and can result in massive financial damages, budget limit based account locks or even suspensions.
