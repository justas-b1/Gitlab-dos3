# Authenticated Gitlab DoS - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption - 8CPU cores (16vCPU) &amp; 11GB RAM - Events Tracking - Low Bandwidth

Gitlab doesn't accept 99.9% of DoS vulnerabilities. This vulnerability is out-of-scope unfortunately üòî.

`DoS vulnerabilities caused by unlimited input fields`

Out-of-scope bugs are useless noise (üóëÔ∏è) ‚Äî they waste time chasing irrelevant issues that don‚Äôt impact the actual target, like reporting a typo in a login page‚Äôs footer. They distract from real threats, clog reports with garbage, and show you didn‚Äôt bother reading the rules.

Submitting them is like demanding a refund for a sandwich you didn‚Äôt order.

## Impact

Auto-scaling under attack can cause a cost spike, potentially breaching budget thresholds or credit limits.

![Cloud Provider Response](images/cloud_provider_response.png)

**Attack Vector (AV:N)** - Attacker can exploit this remotely.

**Attack Complexity (AC:L)** - Attack uses a very simple python script.

**Privileges Required (PR:L)** - The endpoint is authenticated. Requires a simple account.

**User Interaction (UI:N)** - There's no user interaction required.

**Scope (S:C)** - Changed. Affects cloud hosting account if auto-scaling is enabled.

**Integrity Impact (I:N)** - None.

**Availability Impact (A:H)** - High. Instance becomes unavailable for at least 10 seconds and might self-restart.

From https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-security/product-security/appsec/cvss-calculator/

`When evaluating Availability impacts for DoS that require sustained traffic, use the 1k Reference Architecture. The number of requests must be fewer than the "test request per seconds rates" and cause 10+ seconds of user-perceivable unavailability to rate the impact as A:H.`

This attack used < 1RPS.
